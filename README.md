# My Programming Journey 🚀

## Introduction

This repository is where I consolidate my learnings in programming through **Enki** and other resources. It serves as a personal space to document concepts, practice coding, and track my progress over time.

## Purpose

- 📌 Keep a record of what I learn.
- 🧠 Reinforce key programming concepts.
- 💻 Experiment with code and build small projects.
- 🔍 Serve as a reference for future use.

## Getting Started

I'll be adding topics, notes, and code snippets as I progress. Stay tuned for updates!

## Future Plans

- Organize topics into sections.
- Add explanations and code examples.
- Build small projects to apply what I learn.

More to come as I continue my learning journey!
